# Framework Rules

Coding standards, dependency rules, and conventions for the Ask Spurgeon codebase.

## 1. Runtime Environment

- **Python Version**: Enforce **Python 3.11 to 3.13**. Avoid Python 3.14 due to dependency incompatibilities with LlamaIndex and general RAG packages in mid-2026.
- **Configuration Management**: All credentials, vector store endpoints, and LLM providers must be loaded from a `.env` file via `python-dotenv` and centralized in `config.py`.

## 2. Core Libraries & Packages

- **UI Framework**: **Streamlit**. Application execution starts via `streamlit run app.py`.
- **RAG Orchestrator**: **LlamaIndex** is the designated framework for handling document parsing, node generation, embedding, and vector querying.
- **Testing**:
  - Framework: Use `pytest` for unit testing.
  - RAG Validation: Run evaluations with `eval.py` to compare prompt configurations and judge outputs using an LLM-as-a-judge system.

## 3. Vector Database Rules

- **Local Development**: Default to local **ChromaDB** persisted in `./chroma_db` for quick local iteration.
- **Production Integration**: Connect to **Qdrant Cloud** (free tier). Local Docker Qdrant (`docker compose up -d qdrant`) is required when testing production-parity behaviors (e.g., specific metadata filtering).

## 4. Agent Memory Guidelines

- Use the `memory-fabric` MCP tools (`read_combined_context_tool`, `write_local_memory_tool`) to load and maintain local project memories. Direct writes to `.ai-memory/` are prohibited.
